About video

Goals:
-Have a subsystem of a litter detection software specialising on cans

Resources used:
- Choose a neural network 
- Find some datasets
- 

Problems/Difficulties:
- Finding appropriate datasets
- Accounting for deformaty
- Accounting for external effects on the detection (If the can is in grass)

Process/Progess:
- We decided on Tensorflow
    --- Give 3 to 4 reasons (Compare to mathworks and other python alternatives such as OpenCV)
- We started searching for datasets on kaggle
    --- Why did we choose premade datasets? Problems? And so on..
- Research done and material used
    --- Explain material used in 20-30 seconds
- What's next

Video planning:
- Start with a background of cans (marvelous)
- Switch to litter images (wek)
- So here we would introduce to problem

- Current progress:
    - Just go over those points
    - Form it similar to a conclusion
    
General info:
- Should be around 2:30 minutes
- "A process report, or essay, explains how something is done or how something came about. It can be written in detailed step-by-step instructions or in a story format with 
  the instructions subtly threaded throughout the narrative. A process essay has no minimum or maximum length, but five paragraphs is the norm, including an introduction, 
  three body paragraphs and a conclusion."
