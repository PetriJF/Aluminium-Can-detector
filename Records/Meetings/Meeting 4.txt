About video

Goals:
-Have a subsystem of a litter detection software specialising on cans

Resources used:
- Choose a neural network 
- Find some datasets
- 

Problems/Difficulties:
- Finding appropriate datasets
- Accounting for deformaty
- Accounting for external effects on the detection (If the can is in grass)

Project Time/Budget:
- Time: 
	To apply it to a moderate level: 
		- 8 weeks of work needed
		- Recognize cans with a good success
		- Recognizing cans assuming for some deformaty with mild to moderate success
		- Reasonable attempt to account for external effects 
- Budget:
	Budget not determined yet, but possible costs depending on final approach may include:
		- Access to specialized datasets
		- Proper implementation would also need a camera with modifiable setting in order to verify different light effects
		- Research papers that may be behind a paywall
		- Experimental Subject Matter (Cans)

Video planning:
- Start with a background of cans (marvelous)
- Switch to litter images (wek)
- So here we would introduce to problem

- "INTRODUCING NEURAL NETWORKS" - A possible implementation for automatically cleaning the streets of uneducted citizens

- However there will me some obstacles 
	- introducing the problems and possible fixes based on our research

- Accounting for all this, our timeline for implementing this would be:
	.... (also mark possible expenses)

James: Piece the video together
_____: Voice (do we all have to speak?) - Heather for one
Finding copyright free videos and sending them for James to use in making the video - Cael

For Project:

We use TensorFlow
Each of us has to come with:
	By Tuesday:
	- One paper on learning tensorflow
	- One paper on how neural networks work
	By Wednesday:
	- Have PyCharm ready
	- Try getting a kaggle dataset working (Not giving errors)

Big brain task:
Figuring how to rename wiki pages on moodle
Figuring how to delete wiki pages on moodle
