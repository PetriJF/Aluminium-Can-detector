# EE297_Project

This is where we will organize the whole project.

The environment is set of tensorflow 1.13, CUDA 10 and cuDNN 7.4. Any other versions might lead to warnings or plain old errors.

The working Neural Network can be accessed by opening the anaconda environment (Or alternative) and doing the following:
- Go to the directory : models/research/object_detection/
- Type the "idle" command
- Press open, and run the webcam or image python scripts
- Enjoy
