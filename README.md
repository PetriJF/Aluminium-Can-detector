# EE297_Project

This is where we will organize the whole project.

The environment is configured for tensorflow 1.13, CUDA 10 and cuDNN 7.4. Any other versions might form warnings or plain old errors impeding the use of the NN.

The working Neural Network with out can detector model can be accessed by opening the anaconda environment (Or alternative) and doing the following:
- Go to the directory : models/research/object_detection/
- Type the "idle" command
- Press open, and run the webcam or image python scripts
- Enjoy
